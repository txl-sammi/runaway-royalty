## Evaluation Plan

#### Evaluation techniques
Obsevational:  Post-task walkthroughs  
This allows us to gain deep insights into the user experience by having participants explain their thought processes and actions in detail. This qualitative information is crucial for understanding the nuances of how players interact with the game. Participants can provide specific feedback on what worked well and what didn't during their gameplay. 

Querying: Interview and Questionnaire  
The questions are standardized, which can give us quantitative data that can be analyzed statistically, allowing more objective comparisons.  


#### Roles

The roles involved in user evaluation test are as follows. An individual may play multiple roles. All roles will be refered to as an analyst.

| Role        | Description                                                                                                                              | Responsible By |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Facilitator | Send out invitations to the participants. Provides overview of the game to participants. Responds to participant's requests for assistance | Rosa Yan |
| Interviewer | Conducts the interview                                                                                                                    | Sammi Li | 
| Note Taker  | Records participantâ€™s actions and comments during gameplay and interview                                                                 | Yuying Ke |
| Data Logger | Set up screen recording. Organise the data collected                                                                                      | Sylvia Chen |

Every team member will be responsible to spread the google form to a variety of forums for EOI (Expression of Interest). Then the play-testing and evaluations process will be conducted together once participants availabilities are sourced. During the facilitation of observational and querying techniques, we will help out each other as we perform our tasks for our role. However, roles will be mainly allocated to one person in order to maintain standardisation of observation and querying processes. Through this, we will be able to uderstand what everyone is doing and gain an understanding of each process, thus contributing equally to the evaluation. 


#### Timeline
Evaluation implementation: Week 11-12  
Data collection and analysis: Week 12-13  
Identify and implement improvements for the game: Week 13  


#### Participants
We are targeting casual gamers who enjoy relaxing, story-driven, and visually appealing games. These players might not have extensive gaming experience but are looking for an engaging and accessible gaming experience. They value immersive narratives and an aesthetically pleasing environment. They are likely to enjoy games that offer a break from their daily routine and provide a sense of escapism.  

Recruitment:  
Applicants will be sourced from online gaming forums, university campus, social media, gaming discord servers, gaming subreddits - send out a google form asking for required information and expression of interest.
Then from the applicants, reduce to 10 by making sure they fall within the 12-30 age range, screen their gaming experience (favourite games, how often they play, and what types of games they enjoy), ensure they are interested in story-driven and visually appealing games, gather basic demographic information to ensure diversity among participants (gender, ethnicity, educational background), consent and availability. 



### Post-task walkthroughs (five participants):  
#### Methodology  
Analysts are going to invite participants, one at a time, to play the game in a quiet room. Analyst is going to stay with the participants and watch them play. Each participant will have five minutes to play the game and the screen will be recorded. Participants can ask questions during the game play and analysts should record any questions arised. Participants will be aksed to complete following tasks:  
* Kill at least one enemy of each type  
* Collect at least one item of each type  
* Shake a tree  
* Remove at least one barrier  
* Use an item to heal at least once  
* Use an item to restore health of the carriage at least once

After five minutes of game play, show them the footage and ask them to reflect on their actions
Guiding questions:
* 1. Which task did you find difficult to complete?
* 2. What were the key thought processes you went through to complete this task?
* 3. Were there any moments where you had to pause and think about how to proceed? If so, what was causing the hesitation?
* 4. Did you rely on prior knowledge or experience to perform the task, or was it intuitive enough to figure out as you went along?
* 5. Were there any aspects of the task that you found confusing or unclear?
* 6. Did you encounter any unexpected behaviours or responses from the system that hindered your progress?
  

### Interview and questionare:
#### Methodology  
Analysts are going to invite participants to play the game in a quiet room. The analyst is going to stay with the participants and watch them play. Each participant will have five minutes to play the game. Participants can ask questions during the game play and analysts should record any questions that arise. The interviewer will ask the following questions to the participants. The response will be recorded for further analysis.

* 1. What were your initial thoughts and feelings when you started playing the game?
* 2. Did the game instructions effectively communicate the game mechanics?
* 3. How would you describe the core gameplay mechanics of the game? 
* 4. Were the controls intuitive, and did you encounter any difficulties while playing?
* 5. What are your thoughts on the game's graphics and visual style? 
* 6. Were there any elements of the visuals that stood out positively or negatively?
* 7. Were there any places where you felt confused about what to do next?
* 8. Did you find the game too easy, too difficult, or just right?
* 9. How would you rate the quality of the game's audio, including music and sound effects?
* 10. Were there any specific parts of the game that you found particularly challenging or enjoyable?
* 11. Did you encounter any bugs, glitches, or technical issues during your gameplay? 
* 12. Were there moments where the game seemed unresponsive or inconsistent?
* 13. Did you encounter any accessibility issues, such as difficulty with text size or color contrast? 
* 14. Were there moments that stood out as particularly exciting or dull?
* 15. Did you feel motivated to continue playing, and if so, why?
* 16. What are your thoughts on the game's user interface? Was it clear and easy to navigate? 
* 17. Were there any elements of the UI that could be improved for a better user experience?
* 18. Are there any features you would like to see expanded or modified in the full version?
* 19. If there are (e.g. wind skill) introduced in the demo, how would you feel about it?
* 20. Did the game run smoothly without noticeable lag or technical issues?
* 21. Were there any performance-related problems that affected your experience?
* 22. Do you have any additional comments or suggestions for improving the game?

After the interview, participants would be given a questionnaire to fill out. The questionnaire is based on QUIS (Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction), which can help us evaluate players' satisfaction with our game's usability and user interface.

On a scale of 1 to 5, rate:  
Overall Reaction:
* How satisfied are you with your overall experience playing this game?

Visual and Sound feedback:
* How visually appealing do you find the screen design of the game?
* How would you rate the visual design and aesthetics of the game?
* How would you rate the quality of the game's sound effects and music?
* How well did the audio elements contribute positively to the game's atmosphere?

System Information:
* How easy was it to understand the game's rules and mechanics?
* How well did the narrative elements enhance your overall enjoyment of the game?

System Responsiveness:
* How difficult are the game controls to use and understand?
* How responsive was the game to your input?
  
Game experience: (rate 1-5)  
Replayability 
* I fell motivated to continue playing to achieve goals or complete tasks.
* I would like to bookmark the game and play it in casual time.  
  
Time survival mechanism experience  
* The time limits in the game were fair and achievable.
* I felt pressured by the time survival mechanics, which made the game more challenging.

Battle experience
* I enjoyed the combat mechanics and controls during battles.
* The game provided opportunities for me to improve my skills in battle over time.
* The battles in the game were challenging and required strategy.


### Data collection: 
By using post-task walkthrough, interview and questionare, we want to collect following data:  
- Overall Reaction
- Game Responsiveness: task completion rates, time on tasks, step-by-step actions, decision-making processes
- Visual and Sound feedback: UI, sound effect
- Game experience feedback: narrative engagement, difficulty levels, time survival mechanism, combat

### Data analysis:
- Questionnaire responses (mean, standard deviation, frequencies)
- Gameplay metrics: time spent, completion rates, scores - analyse trends and patterns to identify areas that may need improvement
- Interview transcripts: identify specific feedback and insight from participants 
Observations: any observations made my the analyst during gaming sessions (common behaviours, frustrations or positive reactions)
- Compare data across different participant profiles
- Tools required for the data collection and analysis include: recording device, google form of QUIS questions
  

each member will be assigned 2-3 participants to be facilitators for. Whilst the rest of the team will be allocated a different role. 

## Evaluation Report

By the Milestone 3 deadline, your team should have completed your evaluation and made changes to the game based on the feedback received. You should then update the report to summarise your evaluation, including the changes you made to the game as a result. This should be outlined in the README.md template under the Evaluation Report section. If you wish, you may merge the Evaluation Plan into this section and reword it to make this a full (retrospective) report. In any case, make sure participant demographics and the exact methodology you followed is clear in the final report.

Methodology: (exact methodology)


Results: (questionaiire results, interview responses)


Discussion: (discussion of results and why would they be like that)


Conclusion: (what changes are we making)

## Shaders and Special Effects

As per the assessment criteria, there should be discussion around the two custom Cg/HLSL shaders you were required to write, as well as the particle system that your team wishes to be marked. Be sure to include direct links to two .shader files in the repository, in order to make it clear what should be marked. Also include images/gifs that clearly demonstrate the shaders (and particle system) in action.

We expect that you provide context showing how the shader effects fit into the rendering pipeline/Unity engine, taking into account theory as discussed in the workshops and lectures. For example, if shaders take uniform parameters that must be set from a C# script, make sure you explain this and provide a link to that script and discuss how and why the parameters are set in this way. Or if you have a material(s) that parameterise a shader, show where these are applied in the project and how they are used.

## Summary of Contributions

Your team should include a brief summary of the work that each team member did. Each team member may wish to include direct links to files in the repository that demonstrates their code contributions in this section (i.e., .cs and .shader files). This level of detail is not a strict requirement, and isn't directly marked, but it will help us to make decisions in the event that there are disputes over contributions in the team member evaluation.

## References and External Resources

Your team should maintain a list of all external resources that were used in the project, directly or indirectly (see the Academic Honesty section below for details on our expectations regarding external resources).
Include a "References" section at the end of your repository's README.md outlining all external resources used.
For code or game logic, you must also include comments within the respective sourcecode files providing direct link(s) to the sources utilised.
